# Mall Customer Segmentation

This repository contains code and resources for segmenting mall customers based on a dataset of 200 individuals describing five features: name, age, and spending score. The segmentation is achieved through a K-means clustering algorithm, allowing for the categorization of customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing strategies.

## 1. Introduction

Understanding customer behavior is vital for businesses. This project aims to segment mall customers to identify distinct groups with similar purchasing patterns. The K-means clustering algorithm is employed to cluster customers into meaningful segments, enabling personalized marketing approaches.

## 2. Sections

### 2.1 Installing Required Libraries

Before running the code, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. Use the following command to install them:

```
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
```

### 2.2 Descriptive Data Analysis

This section involves exploring the dataset using functions like `info`, `head`, `describe`, and `dtypes` to gain insights into the data's structure and characteristics.

### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, a combination of data visualization techniques and analysis is employed to showcase relationships between different features in the dataset. Visualization aids in understanding patterns and trends among customers.

### 2.4 K-Means Clustering

The K-means clustering algorithm is applied in this step to group customers based on their age and spending score. By clustering these features together, the algorithm identifies five distinct clusters representing different customer segments.

### 2.5 Conclusion

The analysis concludes with the formation of five clusters. These clusters represent specific customer segments, each with unique spending behaviors and demographics. Understanding these segments can guide marketing strategies and enhance the overall shopping experience for customers.

## 3. Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries as mentioned in Section 2.1.

## 4. Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and perform the customer segmentation analysis.
3. Explore the clusters formed and derive insights for marketing strategies.

Feel free to use this repository to explore customer segmentation techniques and adapt them for your own projects.
